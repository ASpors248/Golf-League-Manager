# Back Nine Golf League Managment Application

Third and final capstone at Tech Elevator. Through a mock Agile work flow, our team of five developers working with a "scrum master" and a "product owner" through two weeks of three-day sprints and daily stand ups to develop this golf application. 

It has a Java backend that performs GET and POST requests on a relationtional database that we created ourselves. As well as two APIs. One for weather forcasts and one for Google maps. 

The frontend was built through Vue.js, HTML and CSS. 

Once logged into the app, you can create a league, invite other registered users to the league, create tee times and log scores as the league organizer. If you have an admin account, you can add new courses that aren't already in the system.
